Hi there!

I am a passionate web developer with 3+ years industry experience. Use React.js and latest tools to build PWA projects from inception to deployment/ maintenance, including CI/CD, QA, 100% test coverage, responsive, under Scrum & Lean.

With a keen eye for UI, I can build hi-fidelity prototypes for different form factors, built style guides. Worked with Figma, Zeplin, and Storybook to turn UI designs into React components.

I also love people, love interactions, with years of building relations and interpersonal skills. Like to drive innovation, like to lead by example. Very open to all suggestions, take a proactive lead on things.

Let's connect! :)
