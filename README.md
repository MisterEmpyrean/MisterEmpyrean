### Hi there üëã

I am a passionate web developer with 3+ years industry experience. I use React.js and latest tools to build PWA projects from inception to deployment/ maintenance, including CI/CD, QA, 100% test coverage, responsive, under Scrum & Lean.

With a keen eye for UI, I can build hi-fidelity prototypes for different form factors, built style guides. I also work with Figma, Zeplin, and Storybook to turn UI designs into React components.

I also love people, love interactions, with years of building relations and interpersonal skills. I like to drive innovation, lead by example. I am also very open to all suggestions, take a proactive lead on things.

I strongly feel you're going to be seeing a lot more of me and from me in times to come ‚ù§Ô∏è

Let's connect! :)
